MNIST Image Processing Tool
Introduction
Welcome to the MNIST Image Processing Tool! This tool is designed to help you easily download and process specific JPEG images from the MNIST dataset, which are 28x28 pixels in size. In addition, we've included an extra file called "call.py" that allows you to send in multiple images for processing, including entire folders!

What is MNIST?
MNIST is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits (0-9) that are often used for training and testing machine learning models. Each image in the dataset is 28x28 pixels and is typically used for tasks like digit recognition.

Getting Started
To start using this tool, follow these simple steps:

Download the MNIST JPEG images: To download the MNIST specific JPEG images, clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

Access the images: Once you have the repository on your local machine, you will find the MNIST images in the designated folders.

Using "call.py" for Bulk Processing
"call.py" is a Python script included in this repository that allows you to send multiple images or entire folders for processing. Here's how to use it:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where "call.py" is located.

Run the script by entering the following command:

python call.py path_to_images
Replace path_to_images with the path to the folder containing the images you want to process.

The script will process the images and provide the results.
